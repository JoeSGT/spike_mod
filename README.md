# Spike mod for v1.12
Offers some of the function of ExU spikes, ported originally when spikes in ExU2 did not exist. 
Still in development with the intent to have other options not present in ExU2 that have been requested.
Special thanks to Shadows_of_Fire for 1.12 port, and amazing Looting Spike animation/texturing
